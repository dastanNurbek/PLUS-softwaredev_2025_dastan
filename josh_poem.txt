A poem about a Nut
by Matthew James, Apr 2016
My little nut

My little nut is no ordinary nut
She's small like a nut
She's starting to sprout
She's so eager to reach the clouds
But with her roots firmly in the ground
When people see my little nut, they say
"Isn't she beautiful, isn't she bright?!
Are you sure she didn't fall from a different tree?!"
My little nut skips
My little nut makes me skip
My little nut makes my heart skip
My little nut calls me a poo head
And I poo on my own head
And I'm made of poo
But she doesn't mean it
It's just coz she's a little nut
My little Hazel nut.
